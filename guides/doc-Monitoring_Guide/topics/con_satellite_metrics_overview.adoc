Obtaining metrics from {Project} is useful for troubleshooting a current issue, and capacity planning. This guide describes how to collect live metrics and archive them for a fixed period of time.

Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a suite of tools and libraries for acquiring, storing, and analyzing system-level performance measurements. PCP can be used to analyze live and historical metrics. Metrics can be retrieved and presented via the CLI, or a web UI.

The recommended scenaio is to deploy PCP daemon (pmcd) and monitoring agents on {Project} Server and Grafana web interface on a separate Monitoring Server. A logging daemon (pmlogger) runnon on the monitoring server connects to {Project} Server using TCP connection and samples all monitored data in 1 minute interval and stores them into archive files. User connects to Grafana web interface which is configured to talk to a web server (pmproxy) which fetches data from archives and puts them into Redis memory-only database for high-performance analysis and plotting.

For Satellite deployments on {RHEL} 8, monitoring services can be installed on the Satellite Server itself.
