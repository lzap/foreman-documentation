= Retrieving Live Metrics using CLI

It is useful to be able to retrieve metrics live on the {Project} Server command line. The first step is to identify the metric name, the following command lists all available metrics.

----
# pminfo
----

It can also show other details like description and units. To output metrics on disk writes, enter the following command:
----
# pmval -f 1 disk.partitions.write
----

In this example, PCP converts the number of writes to disk partitions from a counter value, to a rate value. The `-f 1` specifies that the value be abbreviated to one decimal place.

.Example output
[options="nowrap" subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
metric:    disk.partitions.write
host:      {foreman-example-com}
semantics: cumulative counter (converting to rate)
units:     count (converting to count / sec)
samples:   all
